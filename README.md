## Description

"Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application."  Bootstrap and other CSS Frameworks allows developers to predictably and consistently deliver working code that can be easily followed by others.

In this exercise we are:

- Create the following files files: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
- Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

  1. A navbar
  2. A responsive layout
  3. Responsive images

- The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.
- Screenshots are provided as a reference in the Assets/Images folder. Your app does not need to be exactly like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

## Bonus  

- Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation).

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

## What Why and How

This exercise has helped me view UI in logical blocks.  It took some time to get the grid system, but lots of trial and error helped.

## Methods

First I created my respository, then I cloned it to my local workign directory.  Next I created my 'develop' branch and created index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html.  I copied the Bootstrap link into my 'head' and JQuery into 'body', then I created my own style.css and linked it.

Next I watched a video from [freecodecamp.org](https://youtu.be/-Wlt8NRtOpo) that helped me figure out how to set up my navbar and portfolio. It is a tutorial on Flexbox which I decided to use instead of Bootstrap's 'nav' selectors.  

Then we went over the Grid layout in Bootstrap.  I ended up creating my navbar from scratch and after figuring out how to make the footer stick, I applied the same to the navbar.  The form was the easiest.

## Usage

Simple Portfolio Website for Bootstrap Practice.
