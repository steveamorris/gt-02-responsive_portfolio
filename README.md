Use Bootstrap to create a Responsive Portfolio
https://theendisfar.github.io/gt-02-responsive_portfolio/

## Description

"Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application."  Bootstrap and other CSS Frameworks allows developers to predictably and consistently deliver working code that can be easily followed by others.

In this exercise we are:

- Create the following files files: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
- Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

  1. A navbar
  2. A responsive layout
  3. Responsive images

- The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.
- Screenshots are provided as a reference in the Assets/Images folder. Your app does not need to be exactly like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

## Bonus

- Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation).

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

## What Why and How

This exercise has helped me view UI in logical blocks

## Methods

First I created my respository, then I cloned it to my local workign directory.  Next I created my 'develop' branch and created index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html.  I copied the Bootstrap link into my 'head' and JQuery into 'body', then I created my own style.css and linked it.

Next I watched a video from [freecodecamp.org](https://youtu.be/-Wlt8NRtOpo) that helped me figure out how to set up my navbar and portfolio. It is a tutorial on Flexbox which I decided to use instead of Bootstrap's 'nav' selectors.  

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
